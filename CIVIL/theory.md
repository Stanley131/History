### Principle of Achaeology 
  - the universe is about 10 Billion years old 
  - earth is about 4.6 billion years old 
  - To help make this huge time span comprehensible, archaeologists and
    geol- ogists have developed systems for breaking the vastness of time
    into smaller seg- ments. Archaeologists deal with the period of humans
    on the planet, roughly the past 5 or 6 million years. Archaeologists
    use geological time, but they also have created a means of reckoning
    time that reflects changes in human behavior and artifacts. This
    archaeological system of chronology involves divisions such as Pa-
    leolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age and is discussed in
    more detail in a subsequent chapter.
  - Geologists deal with the entire history of the earth and distinguish a series
    of eras representing major episodes, usually separated by significant changes
    in the plant and animal kingdoms.
### Change
  - Change, modification, variation—these themes describe the path of evolution from
    the first self-replicating molecules to fully modern humans of today.
