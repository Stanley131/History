### L. H. Morgan’s (1877) Evolutionary Schema
  - Lower savagery
  - Middle Savagery: control of fire, fishing nets 
  - Upper Savagery: Bow and Arrow 
  - Lower Barbarism: ceramics 
  - Middle Barbarism: Farming and Herding
  - Upper Barbarism: iron Tools 
  - Civilization: writing 
### Early Civilization
  - Mesoamerica, Peru, Nile Vallay, Lower Mesopotamia, Indus. Hsia
  
### Principle of Achaeology 
  - the universe is about 10 Billion years old 
  - earth is about 4.6 billion years old 
  - To help make this huge time span comprehensible, archaeologists and
    geol- ogists have developed systems for breaking the vastness of time
    into smaller seg- ments. Archaeologists deal with the period of humans
    on the planet, roughly the past 5 or 6 million years. Archaeologists
    use geological time, but they also have created a means of reckoning
    time that reflects changes in human behavior and artifacts. This
    archaeological system of chronology involves divisions such as Pa-
    leolithic, Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age and is discussed in
    more detail in a subsequent chapter.
  - Geologists deal with the entire history of the earth and distinguish a series
    of eras representing major episodes, usually separated by significant changes
    in the plant and animal kingdoms.
### Change
  - Change, modification, variation—these themes describe the path of evolution from
    the first self-replicating molecules to fully modern humans of today.
   - Biological Evolution: On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection
        - Darwin pointed out that all organisms produce more offspring than can survive 
          and that the individuals that survive do so because of certain advantageous 
          characteristics they possess.
 ### Fundamentals of Achaeology 
  - archaeology is the study of our human past, combining the themes of time and change,
    using the material remains that have survived.
  - Archaeology focuses on past human behavior and change in society over time.   
    Archaeologists study past human culture across an enormous amount of time and
    space—essentially, the last several million years and all of the continents except
    Antarctica. In one sense, archaeology is the investigation of the choices that our
    ancestors made as they evolved from the first humans to the historical present.
  - Archaeology is also a detective story, a mystery far more complex and
    harder to solve than most crimes. The clues to past human behavior are
    enigmatic—broken, decomposed, and often missing. Piecing together these bits
    of information to make sense of the activities of our ancestors is a challenge.
  - Archaeology is usually situated in the social sciences or humanities in a 
    university setting.
  - enquiry. Prehistory refers to the time of humans before the written record placed us 
    in history.
  - Archaeological Sites are found by accident. 
  - Physical and Chemical analysis of soil samples may provide information about the
    origins of the deposits.
